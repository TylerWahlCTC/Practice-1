<h1><strong>Volunteer Opportunities</strong></h1>
<p>Volunteers are the lifeblood of the Mt Pleasant Animal Shelter. We welcome volunteers of all ages, but 
those under 18 must volunteer with a family member.</p>
<p>To volunteer, you must attend an orientation session, which are held monthly. You also must complete 
the <a href="https://mjshelter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Volunteer-Application2017.pdf">Application2017</a> . Complete it and bring with you to orientation.</p>
<p>Orientation should last about 1 hour, then you will set up your first volunteering time with a mentor 
who is an experienced volunteer to show you the ins and out of everything we do here. After that you 
will be certified to volunteer on your own.</p>
<p>A few notes:<p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>You must be 18 to volunteer, or with a parent or guardian at all times to be a volunteer.</li>
    <li>The shelter is open to the volunteers EVERYDAY as the animals need to be cared for EVERYDAY!!</li>
    <li> You may volunteer between the hours of 8-4 daily.</li>
    <li>If you feel uncomfortable with an animal, DO NOT feel obligated to walk, or take it to the play 
    yard, or play room, each and every animal will be given their time to play throughout the day.</li>
    <li>HAVE FUN!</li>
</ol>
<p>THANK YOU TO ALL THE NEW VOLUNTEERS WHO CAME OUT, CAN’T WAIT TO SEE YOU ALL AT THE 
SHELTER FOR LOTS OF VOLUNTEERING FUN!</p>

Those needing to fill community service hours may do so without attending volunteer training. They will 
not be allowed to come in contact with the animals and may volunteer without a parent present if they 
are under 18. It is recommended that those filling community service hours arrive at 8 a.m. and be 
prepared to sweep, mop or do dishes.</p>

    <li>For court-ordered community service, visit the Mt Pleasant Police Department to receive 
necessary paper work.</li>
